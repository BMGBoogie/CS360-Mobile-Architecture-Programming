Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal that I developed during this project is used to aid in the management of inventory within a location. The app needed to be able to store the various items and and their corresponding information such as quantity and description. This would allow anyone accessing the database to review the values and to make alterations if needed, assuming they have been granted to proper permissions.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The primary focus that the application needed was to create a database that was viewable and had the ability to be updated as needed. The creation of that screen was my primary focus, followed by the next most important feature that ensured the users that were operating within the app are accounted for, which was the log in screen. Finally, I created a page that would allow the user to accept SMS messages from the application as needed. While I needed to maintain the proper functionality and I wanted to app to look and feel complete, I tried to keep simplistic and only include the features that were necessary.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The two main approaches that I used to plan the coding of my application were User Stories and pseudocode. The user stories for the code helped me decide the layout and design that would be most beneficial when it came to functionality of the application. The pseudocode helped me on the development side of the application as it helped me understand the connections that needed to occur within the application for it to be most beneficial and operate as intended.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
When I began testing my application, there were many issues that I encountered with it. First and foremost, many of my resources were not calling on the databases for the information, like the credentials or the inventory items. Secondly, the other major issue that I encountered came when I was trying to create the APK file for the application. I continued to experience issues such as duplicate items or merger issues.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I think that the biggest challenge I needed to try and overcome was between the design and development of the application. This was the first time that I have dealt with the front end and back end simultaneously and while I understood most of the processes, it still took me a while to fully comprehend what needed to take place.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think the component that I am most proud of with my application is the main database. I think that the UI is appealing and contains all of the necessary information without being complex and confusing. It is simplistic and clearly defines the actions for the items.
